**Projects**

-   Senior Design Project – *“ZipScope” was a proof of concept that was designed
    to be an all-in-one replacement for the usual assortment of testbench
    equipment. Algorithms were applied to combine test cases and improve their
    speed. This ambitious project required extreme team work and motivation. We
    used software such as LabView, Matlab, and Eclipse for C programming. We
    utilized both Linux and Windows OS while interfacing with the Zoom™ OMAP
    L-138 eXperimenter Kit.*

-   Class Design Project – *“TravelRight” was a trip planner web service where I
    served as group leader for the UI team, I was responsible to coordinate the
    members of the UI team to design and build the TravelRight website. We
    resolved user requirements while collaborating with both vendor and core
    groups. In addition we wanted to design a website that was aesthetically
    pleasing to look at and use.*
